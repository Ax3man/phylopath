\title{Plot path coefficients and their confidence intervals or standard errors.}
\usage{
coef_plot(fitted_DAG, error_bar = "ci", order_by = "default", from = NULL,
  to = NULL, reverse_order = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted_DAG}{A fitted DAG, usually obtained by \code{\link[=best]{best()}}, \code{\link[=average]{average()}} or \code{\link[=est_DAG]{est_DAG()}}.}

\item{error_bar}{Whether to use confidence intervals (\code{"ci"}) or standard errors (\code{"se"}) as
error bars. Will force standard errors with a message if confidence intervals are not
available.}

\item{order_by}{By \code{"default"}, the paths are ordered as in the the model that is supplied.
Usually this is in the order that was established by \code{[phylo_path()]} for all combined graphs.
This can be change to \code{"causal"} to do a reordering based on the model at hand, or to
\code{"strength"} to order them by the standardized regression coefficient.}

\item{reverse_order}{If \code{TRUE}, the paths are plotted in reverse order.
Particularly useful in combination with \code{\link[ggplot2:coord_flip]{ggplot2::coord_flip()}} to create
horizontal versions of the plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Plot path coefficients and their confidence intervals or standard errors.
}
\examples{
  d <- DAG(LS ~ BM, NL ~ BM, DD ~ NL + LS)
  plot(d)
  d_fitted <- est_DAG(d, rhino, rhino_tree, 'lambda')
  plot(d_fitted)
  coef_plot(d_fitted)
  # to create a horizontal version, use this:
  coef_plot(d_fitted, reverse_order = TRUE) + ggplot2::coord_flip()
}
